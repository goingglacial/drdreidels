                <h1>FAQ</h1>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Is this an overnight event?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">While we all love overnight hackathons (and slumber parties), sleep is important, too. We'll break for the evening just before midnight and then reconvene on Saturday at 8:30am.</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">I've never attended a hackathon before - can I still come to Summer Hack Day?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely! Summer Hack Day is for beginners and veterans alike. We strive to create an inviting and welcoming atmosphere that is conducive to building awesome hacks and making new friends. Even our senior engineers (who will be team mentors) are encouraged to try something new.</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How much does it cost to attend?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">It's free!</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Do I have to be a woman to attend?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">Yes. This hackathon is open to all people who identify as women.</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Do I have to be an intern?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">Not necessarily. You could also be doing research, taking time off from school, starting your own company, or attending a hacker boot camp. If you're the kind of person who would be eligible for an internship these days, then you're eligible for Summer Hack Day. This hackathon is about bringing together women who are preparing to enter the software industry.</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Do I have to be an engineer?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">Not necessarily (though it helps). We'll also accept applications from designers, product inventors, and data scientists. Do note that unlike some hackathons, Summer Hack Day isn't a “pitch your business model" event. This is a maker's event. So if you like to make things, with computers, and ideally with code, then you'll be a great addition to any team.</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Do I have to be part of a team before showing up?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">Nope! We'll have team-forming on Friday night. You'll get to meet dozens of the most talented women interns in the Bay Area, and we're confident you'll find some amazing new friends to hack with.</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What's the best way to make my application stand out?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">Just be yourself! &hearts; And fill out all the questions; that really helps.</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How many people will you accept?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">We'll accept up to 100 people.</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">When will I hear whether my application has been accepted or not?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">All applicants will be notified of the status of their application - either accepted or waitlisted - by June 12th.</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What if my plans change and I'm no longer available that weekend?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">You should notify us ASAP so we can accept someone off the waitlist. If you're accepted, we're going to assume you're coming (and we're going to order some sweet swag for you, too), but we understand that schedules shift and the common cold can strike at any time. Just make sure to keep us in the loop!</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What should I bring?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">Your favorite laptop, a charger, and anything else that helps you be productive (if you want to make a phone app, for example, a phone would be handy). We'll provide food and drinks and all the other creature comforts.</div>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What if I have more questions?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:summerhackday2015@dropbox.com">summerhackday2015@dropbox.com</a>.</div>
